Tenzies is a simple game where you keep rolling dice until they are all the same value. 

## How To Play
On the initialization roll, you freeze the dice with your chosen value and then re-roll. The frozen dice maintain their values while the remaining are re-rolled. You continue freezing the die with your chosen value until all the frozen dice are the same value, and then you win. Try to beat your best game!
